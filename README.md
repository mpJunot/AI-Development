# AI-Development

This repository implements several machine learning and deep learning models, including:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)
- Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)
- BERT
- And more

These models are intended for experimentation, research, and educational purposes.
